# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Shell Environment

**Important**: The user may be using fish shell as their default shell. When generating terminal commands, use `bash -c 'your_bash_command'` to ensure compatibility with the fish shell environment.

## Planning and Task Management

**Important**: Before doing anything, ask me if it's necessary to create a detailed checklist markdown file that categorizes the upcoming work in the `.checklist` directory. Ask me all the questions that should be confirmed in advance when making plans.

## Project Context

- Reference README.md for project overview.
- After you make changes, always update the README.md to reflect the current state of the project.
- Instead of deleting files, move them to the `.archive` directory.
