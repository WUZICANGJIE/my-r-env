  - [x] Build environment verification

### üîÑ Testing & Validation Needed

#### Questions for Confirmation:

1. **Platform-Specific Testing**
   - [ ] Should we test the script on actual systems for each OS?
   - [ ] Do you have access to all target platforms for testing?
   - [ ] Are there specific Docker installation preferences for each platform?

2. **Docker Installation Behavior**
   - [ ] Should the script automatically start Docker service installation?
   - [ ] How should we handle existing Docker installations that need updates?
   - [ ] Should we support rootless Docker installations?

3. **Error Handling & Recovery**
   - [ ] What should happen if Docker installation fails?
   - [ ] Should we provide manual installation instructions for all platforms?
   - [ ] How verbose should error messages be?

4. **User Experience**
   - [ ] Should we add a progress bar for long operations?
   - [ ] Do you want interactive prompts or silent operation options?
   - [ ] Should we save installation logs for debugging?

5. **Integration with Existing Scripts**
   - [ ] Should we modify other scripts to use the new validation functions?
   - [ ] Do we need to update the README.md with new setup instructions?
   - [ ] Should we create a quick setup guide for new users?

### üìù Next Phase Planning

#### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Optional)
- [ ] **Advanced Docker Features**
  - [ ] Docker Compose support detection
  - [ ] Container registry authentication
  - [ ] Multi-architecture build verification
  - [ ] Resource limit recommendations

- [ ] **Development Environment Setup**
  - [ ] IDE/Editor configuration detection
  - [ ] Git configuration verification
  - [ ] SSH key setup for container access
  - [ ] Development tools installation (optional)

- [ ] **Monitoring & Diagnostics**
  - [ ] Performance benchmarking
  - [ ] Container health checks
  - [ ] Resource usage monitoring
  - [ ] Build time optimization suggestions

#### Phase 4: Documentation & Distribution
- [ ] **Documentation Updates**
  - [ ] Update README.md with new setup process
  - [ ] Create platform-specific setup guides
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting documentation
  - [ ] Create video tutorials (optional)

- [ ] **Testing & CI/CD**
  - [ ] Automated testing on multiple platforms
  - [ ] Container image testing
  - [ ] Performance regression testing
  - [ ] Security vulnerability scanning

### üö® Critical Decision Points

#### Immediate Decisions Needed:
1. **Docker Installation Strategy**
   - Should we use official Docker installation scripts?
   - Do we need to support both Docker CE and Docker Desktop?
   - How do we handle corporate/enterprise Docker installations?

2. **Platform Support Level**
   - Full automatic installation vs. guidance-only for some platforms?
   - Should we support older OS versions?
   - What's the minimum system requirements we should enforce?

3. **User Permission Model**
   - Require sudo access for Docker installation?
   - Provide alternative instructions for users without admin rights?
   - How to handle different security policies?

#### Long-term Decisions:
1. **Maintenance Strategy**
   - How often should we update OS detection logic?
   - Who maintains platform-specific installation code?
   - What's our deprecation policy for older platforms?

2. **Feature Scope**
   - Should this remain a simple setup script?
   - Do we want to evolve it into a full development environment manager?
   - Integration with other R environment tools?

### üîß Technical Debt & Improvements

#### Current Implementation Notes:
- Script uses bash for maximum compatibility
- Fallback mechanisms for systems without specific features
- Modular design allows easy addition of new platforms
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

#### Potential Improvements:
- [ ] Add JSON/YAML configuration file support
- [ ] Implement plugin system for custom checks
- [ ] Add telemetry/analytics (with user consent)
- [ ] Create GUI version for non-technical users

### üìä Success Metrics

#### Implementation Success:
- [x] Script runs without errors on initial test
- [ ] All target platforms successfully detected
- [ ] Docker installation works on each platform
- [ ] Build process completes successfully after setup

#### User Experience Success:
- [ ] Average setup time under 10 minutes
- [ ] Less than 3 user interactions required
- [ ] Clear error messages and recovery instructions
- [ ] Zero manual intervention needed for common cases

## ü§î Questions for Project Planning

Before proceeding with additional features, please confirm:

1. **Scope**: Is the current implementation sufficient, or do you want additional features?
2. **Testing**: How should we validate the script across different platforms?
3. **Integration**: Should we update other project files to reference the new setup process?
4. **Documentation**: What level of documentation update is needed?
5. **Maintenance**: Who will maintain platform-specific code as OS versions evolve?
